# Machine-Learning-Automation

This App is a graphical interface for machine learning, it lets the user input his data in a tabular form, choose the goal collumn and work with the caret package in a graphical interface

Current implementations lets us choose between classification problems and regression problems, the regression problem tell us the RMSE for each model tested for a choosen algorithim, while the classification problem gives the user the accuracy.

The user can choose which variables wont be used for the model as well with a multi select input term and after a model is trained, there is a download button which downloads the trained model into a Rdata file for the user to load in a R or python session


Install from parallel implementation to use all cores in your machine but one for the os

Install from serial implementation otherwise
